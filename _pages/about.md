I am a second-year master’s student at the School of Artificial Intelligence([https://sai.bupt.edu.cn/](https://ai.bupt.edu.cn/)), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) (https://www.bupt.edu.cn/). My research interests focus on the interdisciplinary study of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Deep Learning**, with a particular emphasis on their practical applications in scenarios such as affective computing and human-computer dialogue. Specific areas of my research interest include:  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Low-resource sentiment analysis, context understanding and response generation for dialogue systems, lightweight optimization of pre-trained language models;  
- Reinforcement Learning: Policy learning in multi-turn dialogue, dynamic optimization of NLP tasks based on reinforcement learning, design and optimization of reward functions;  
- Deep Learning Fundamentals: Application of few-shot learning in NLP tasks, design of efficient neural network architectures, and improvement of model generalization ability.  

I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Xiaojie Wang — whose team has long focused on research in natural language processing, affective computing, and human-computer interaction — and I am currently involved in
My main responsibilities include model design, experimental data processing, comparative experiment validation, and result analysis.
